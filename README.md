# ! README !

In this repository, you will find challenges from the Computing and Interfaces course taught by Professor `Juan Carlos Martinez` at `Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar`. The course offers the opportunity to explore from the theory of computer sciences to the practical implementation of interfaces for sensors and actuators. Through object-oriented programming, you will learn to build information systems capable of storing and managing data from sensors.

## Objectives
- Understand the theory and application of object-oriented programming: Acquire a solid understanding of the principles and practices of object-oriented programming.
- Build physical computing models: Develop skills to create and manipulate models that integrate hardware and software.
- Use standardized APIs and tools: Learn to utilize standard interfaces and tools for programming biomedical instrumentation systems.
- Build information systems: Implement systems to ensure the persistence and effective management of sensor data.

## Pre-requirements
To successfully run and work on the Java projects in this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1.) Java Development Kit (JDK):

Install JDK 8 or later. The JDK provides the necessary tools for developing and running Java applications.

2.) Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VsCode, or NetBeans is recommended for easier development and debugging.
